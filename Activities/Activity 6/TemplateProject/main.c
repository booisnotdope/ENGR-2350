//** to ease debugging/grading by the staff.

// We'll always add this include statement. This basically takes the
// code contained within the "engr_2350_msp432.h" file and adds it here.
#include "engr2350_msp432.h"

// Add function prototypes here, as needed.


// Add global variables here, as needed.


int main (void) /** Main Function **/
{  
    // Add local variables here, as needed.

    // We always call the "SysInit()" first to set up the microcontroller
    // for how we are going to use it.
    SysInit();

    // Place initialization code (or run-once) code here

    while(1)
    {  
        // Place code that runs continuously in here

    }   
}   

// Add function declarations here as needed

// Add interrupt functions last so they are easy to find
