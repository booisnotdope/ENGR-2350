Embedded Controls
Engineering laboratory introduction to the microprocessor as an embedded element of engineering systems. Students simultaneously develop the hardware and software of one or more target systems during the semester. Topics include concepts and practices of microcontroller hardware and software for command, sensing, control, and display. Specifically, this includes control of dynamic systems and sensor interfaces; analog-digital conversion; parallel input/output; driver circuits, modular programming, and subsystem integration.
